Better internal quality makes adding new features easier, therefore quicker and cheaper. Rebecca and I may have the same application now, but in the next few months Rebecca's high internal quality allows her to add new features every week, while I'm stuck trying chop through the cruft to get just a single new feature out. I can't compete with Rebecca's speed, and soon her software is far more featureful than mine. Then all my customers delete my app, and get Rebecca's instead, even as she's able to increase her price.","comment":""}

But they tend to treat them as autonomous social objects, instead of merely veils for something deeper and more underlying. Nazism was treated as an ontological thing unto itself — we could ask why it arose, but there seemed little doubt that it was a cohesive ideological movement rather than a manifestation of something truer or more real. People theorized that the economic hardships of interwar Germany helped give rise to Nazism, but there was little appetite for equating Nazism with economic anxiety.\n\nMaybe we should treat Trumpism similarly. Instead of asking whether it’s really just this or that, maybe we should accept that whatever its origin story, as of now it’s really just Trumpism. It’s a canon of beliefs (“Antifa is taking over America”, “the 2020 election was stolen”, and so on), with a set of believers who embrace a set of tactics for seizing power. It’s an ideological movement, and maybe it needs to be confronted and defeated as an ideological movement instead of psychoanalyzed. There will be plenty of time for theorizing about its deep roots after it no longer poses a clear and present danger to the Republic.\n\n","comment":""}

A lot of us are constantly wondering, Did I offend that person? Do they like me? What are they thinking? Did I understand their intentions?” To Clark, the most noticeable thing about the mind was the way its understandings were so often swift and perfectly tailored to the body’s needs; Hohwy noticed how often things went wrong. “I think a lot about mental illness,” he says. “We forget what a high per cent of us have some mental illness or other, and they’re all characterized by the internal model losing its robustness.

In addition to this, megalomaniacs have dreams of power, success and wealth.[48] Overall, megalomania involves intense feelings of grandiosity. Those with this condition are believed to have internal feelings of inferiority, which they attempt to suppress by seeking admiration from others.[49] It shares many similarities to narcissism, though there are a few differences. Perhaps most noteworthy of all, megalomaniacs are generally more concerned with superiority, while narcissists are more associated with feelings of excessive self-worth. Megalomania does not share narcissistic traits such as a sense of entitlement, attention-seeking behavior, desire for admiration or intolerance towards criticism. While narcissists are preoccupied with attempting to belittle others, megalomaniacs believe they have already dominated others, and need to maintain the domination. Also, megalomaniacs are highly conceited, while narcissists, particularly the vulnerable type, can often have low levels of self-esteem and self-confidence.","comment":""}

With these opportunities, though, come questions about the impact of new ways of acquiring information on our brain and mind. Many commentators argue that access to the Internet is having a persistent detrimental impact on the brain. In particular, attention has been implicated as a cognitive function that has been negatively impacted by use of digital technologies for learning. In this paper, we critique this claim by analyzing the current understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of attention and research in educational settings on how technologies are influencing learning. Across the two bodies of literature, a complex situation emerges placing doubt on the claim that the use of digital technologies for learning is negatively affecting the brain. We suggest therefore that a more systemic approach to understanding the relationship between technologies and attention involving researchers examining the relationship at different levels from the laboratory to the real world.","comment":""}

{"created":1606696185121,"url":"uptodate.com/contents/management-of-knee-osteoarthritis","quote":"MILD KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS\nNonpharmacologic interventions are the backbone of knee osteoarthritis (OA) management, irrespective of OA severity, and can be used in combination with pharmacologic therapy (algorithm 1). The duration of therapy depends upon the individual patient's needs; however, lifelong treatment with nonpharmacologic therapies is generally recommended in order to relieve symptoms and prevent further joint damage.\nInitial nonpharmacologic measures — Nonpharmacologic interventions in the management of patients with mild OA includes exercise and, when pertinent, weight loss.\n\nExercise — In all patients with knee OA, we recommend ongoing exercise for pain relief and joint protection. Exercise, alongside weight loss when indicated, is a core component of knee OA management [2,3,5,14,15]. All patients with knee OA should be counseled on exercise irrespective of age, radiographic disease severity, pain intensity, functional levels, and comorbidities. A Cochrane review of 54 trials, among which 19 were considered as \"low risk of bias,\" concluded that there is moderate- to high-quality evidence suggesting that land-based exercise improves knee pain and function with moderate effect size immediately after treatment [14]. This magnitude of effect is comparable to that reported for oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [5]. However, the benefits of exercise were not sustained in the long term, which is largely related to the decreasing adherence rates to the exercise program over time [15]. Strategies to improve adherence should be adopted, such as patient education about OA and the benefits of exercise and long-term monitoring. (See \"Overview of the management of osteoarthritis\", section on 'General principles' and \"Overview of the management of osteoarthritis\", section on 'Monitoring and assessment'.)\n\nAt present, there is no strong evidence on the best prescription of exercise modalities and dosage (ie, intensity, duration, and frequency) [16]. In clinical practice, exercise prescription is frequently personalized according to individual findings. We refer our patients for physical therapy to optimize the effectiveness of the exercise program [17]. We prefer a combination of low-impact aerobic fitness training (eg, walking, cycling, rowing, and deep-water running) and lower-limb strengthening exercises, which addresses the full spectrum of impairments in most patients with knee OA. Nevertheless, exercise choice should be also based on patient's mobility, specific impairments (eg, strength, range of motion, aerobic fitness, and balance), and preferences [16]. Exercises involving high impact on the joints such as running or jumping are usually discouraged in order to avoid further joint damage, especially in cases of more advanced OA, although research evidence demonstrating an association between running and progression of knee OA is scarce [18]. For those patients who already run or jog for exercise and develop mild symptoms of OA but wish to continue running, we advocate a load management approach with attention paid to factors such as rest days, running surface, distance and speed, and footwear, as well as building up muscle strength. Stretching or flexibility exercises, particularly of the hamstrings to avoid or minimize flexion contracture of the knee, can also be part of the exercise program to increase knee range of motion [16,17].\n\nAquatic exercise also has clinically relevant effects on knee pain, function, and stiffness, but the effects are small when compared with non-treatment controls [19]. This exercise modality is particularly useful for patients with severe pain and/or poor physical function due to its better tolerance and lower potential to cause adverse events.\n\nWe also consider Tai Chi as a treatment option for the rehabilitation of patients with knee OA, according to patients' preferences. Despite the limited number of large trials investigating the long-term effects of Tai Chi, it has been shown to be as effective as a standard exercise program after 12 weeks in terms of knee pain, physical function, and reduction in analgesic use, in addition to having greater improvement in depression [20,21]. Moreover, Tai Chi improves balance and is associated with a reduced falls risk in older patients with knee OA [22].\n\nWeight loss — Because of the substantial load placed on the knees during weightbearing activities, maintaining an ideal body weight is critical to preserve joint structures and improve symptoms. In addition to the mechanical consequences of obesity and overweight to the joint, adipokines released by the adipose tissue such as leptin and adiponectin are directly involved in the inflammatory component of OA and cartilage damage [23,24]. (See \"Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis\" and \"Comorbidities that impact management of osteoarthritis\", section on 'Obesity'.)\n\nWe encourage health care professionals to consult available local community programs or refer patients to a dietitian to ensure that overweight and obese patients are offered optimal support to lose weight [25]. (See \"Obesity in adults: Overview of management\".)\n\nOur approach of a combination of a calorie-restricted diet and physical activity to achieve weight loss is supported by several studies [26]. As an example, the IDEA trial randomized 454 overweight and obese adults with knee OA into one of three groups: diet plus exercise, diet alone, or exercise alone [27]. Participants in the diet plus exercise group had the highest percentage of weight lost (11.4 percent of body weight) and improvement in pain after 18 months, achieving a decrease in pain scores of approximately 50 percent, with 38 percent of patients reporting no or little pain at the end of the trial.\n\nMoreover, a dose-response relationship between the extent of percentage change in body weight and improvement in joint symptoms has been demonstrated, with more robust effects achieved when at least a 10 percent reduction in body weight is attained [28]. A reasonable initial target is a 5 to 10 percent weight reduction within a six-month period [29], and initial goals should be reassessed periodically and individually for each patient.\n\nCaloric restriction, particularly in order adults, may contribute to loss of lean mass and lead to muscle weakness and should, therefore, be combined with strengthening exercises to prevent these adverse effects. Other interventions such as anti-obesity drugs (eg, orlistat) and surgical approaches (eg, gastric bypass) are less well studied in the context of OA. (See \"Obesity in adults: Overview of management\".)","comment":""}

The artist first makes a model and then rigs it with different points of movement. Then animators select the different gestures of movement they want, with the software filling in the points between. After that it’s a matter of camera work, like which angle you are viewing the model from. Because of this rigid structure, it’s difficult to have three-dimensional characters do the impossible movements that traditional animation is so famous for. Of course, it can be done and often is, but it’s a different kind of art, and it’s not one the Ghibli studio was ready to take on — especially since computer-rendering was brought in to save money rather than usher in a new artistic standard, as Pixar once did.","comment":""}

They often neglect the 2 most powerful mechanisms to social change: Economic incentives, and UX design (User Interaction Design). \n\nUX, essentially the guided manipulation of users, has such a profound effect on human behaviour, but is often seen as unethical. \nTake for example the story of Febreze which was originally an odorless smell-remover. It didn't sell. Only after they added perfume and marketed it as a \"finish\" after cleaning, it exploded in sales. \nhttp://www.behaviouraldesign.com/2016/06/07/how-the-worlds-best-marketer-got-it-wrong-but-eventually-got-it-right/\n\nSuch manipulation is often seen as \"unethical\", but I believe in most cases the \"why\" not the \"how\" determines the ethical value. The whole world is in a game of manipulation. Neglecting its effectiveness robs well-intended spirits of the most powerful tools, and leave it to those who use use it foster their own positions of power or profits."}

The Co-Living operating model is hospitality focused. On-site staff and app-based communication for each building can provide genuine support to residents, such as centralised ordering and distribution of food deliveries, medical assistance, and regular contact to monitor wellbeing.\r\n\r\n2. Studios are easier to keep clean; you don’t have flatmates in your private space.\r\n\r\n3. Co-Living operators create active communities within their buildings. This means virtual social gatherings, online exercise classes, and support groups, to name a few. All these are important for single person households facing loneliness and isolation during lockdown.\r\n\r\n4. Co-Working is built in to most Co-Living developments.

It wasn’t really his thing, the existence of God, but that was the opening there was. Meanwhile, he taught a night class on the mind and artificial intelligence, and began to read about what became known later as gofai—Good Old Fashioned A.I. gofai created a kind of machine intelligence by programming computers with a knowledge base of symbols, and algorithms to manipulate them. gofai had proved quite successful at solving certain sorts of problems—problems requiring logic and precision, the kind that humans tended to find difficult. But it was very distant from the cognition you might find in a real animal. Humans could do logic problems, but usually only with the help of tools, like pen and paper.

Since R and V are both orthogonal matrices, we know their product will also be orthogonal, so we can simplify this further to A = UΣV’ where U is the orthogonal rotation matrix R multiplied by the orthogonal matrix V.","comment":"This paragraph is well written but runs quite long.

{"created":1603028346102,"url":"recruiter.com/i/freelance-vs-full-time-when-to-hire-which-type-of-talent","quote":"Is hiring a full-time employee always “better”? Should you only hire freelancers when you want to reduce costs? Not exactly. There are pros and cons to either direction. The goals of your business in the short- and long-term will dictate which makes more sense in any given scenario.\r\n\r\nWhy Hire a Freelancer\r\n\r\nIt is easier than ever to find freelancers who can tackle specific tasks for your small business, whether those are one-off projects like building a website or ongoing needs like writing blog posts. Either way, there are a few benefits to going this route.\r\n\r\n1. Lower Overall Costs\r\n\r\nThe most obvious benefit to hiring a freelancer over a full-time employee concerns your immediate bottom line. When you hire a freelancer, you might pay them a higher hourly or daily rate than you would a full-timer, but you aren’t required to cover their health benefits or pay Medicare and Social Security taxes. If your freelancer works remotely, you’ll also save on office space and other resources.\r\n\r\n2. Reduced Risk of Legal Problems\r\n\r\nBusinesses that hire freelancers are typically safe from being sued for harassment or discrimination. This doesn’t give you the right to mistreat or otherwise abuse your freelance hires, but you are less likely to face a lawsuit from a disgruntled worker if you hire them on a freelance basis.\r\n\r\n3. Easier to Move On\r\n\r\nWhen you hire an employee, you need to be absolutely sure they are the right person for the job. The cost of replacing a bad fit is high, which can lead to a business sinking lots of time and resources into low-achieving hires in the hopes of turning the situation around.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, freelancers are typically hired on a per-project basis. Letting the freelancer go is as simple and painless as sending an email. If you take a risk on a freelancer and it doesn’t work out, that’s okay — you can just find another. If your goals change and you need to scale down your operations, it’s a lot easier to part ways with a freelancer than a salaried employee.\r\n\r\n4. Tap a Wider Talent Base\r\n\r\nWhen you hire a freelancer, you are not constrained by your local talent market. You can hire remote freelancers from around the world, as long as they meet your requirements and can deliver on your deadlines. You might save even more money if you hire workers in markets where the going rate is cheaper than in your own.\r\n\r\n5. Affordable Access to an Expert Skill Set\r\n\r\nHave a highly specific or highly advanced task, such as a data science project that requires deep knowledge of machine learning? A skilled freelancer can knock it out at a fraction of the cost of a full-time hire with the same skill set.\r\n\r\nWhy Hire a Full-Time Employee\r\n\r\nIn some businesses and for some roles, it is just not possible to hire a freelancer. For example, only an in-house employee can work the floor at a retail business. There are other situations, too, in which a small business would be better off hiring an employee:\r\n\r\n1. In-Depth Projects That Require Attention to Detail\r\n\r\nYou simply can’t guarantee the quality of work a freelancer will deliver, especially when that freelancer works remotely and outside your sphere of supervision. Revisions and re-dos are expected when working with a freelancer, but for in-depth tasks that require attention to detail and getting it right the first time, it makes more sense to hire an in-house employee.\r\n\r\n2. Workplace Culture Flounders Without Full-Timers\r\n\r\nIf you are increasingly farming out important tasks to freelancers — leaving your full-time employees isolated, unchallenged, and underpaid — you’re going to have a problem with workplace culture. Even if your business is just you and your partner at the moment, you’ll never develop the kind of winning office culture that attracts top talent if you only hire transient freelancers.\r\n\r\n3. Greater Commitment to the Company\r\n\r\nFor a freelancer, your business may be one of many gigs that demand their time and attention. If you pay your full-time workers a fair salary, your company will be their sole professional focus. Full-timers will also be more motivated to see the company succeed, because a thriving company means more opportunity and more reward for them. Freelancers know they will move on shortly, so they have less reason to be invested in the company’s success.\r\n\r\nHow to Decide Whom to Hire\r\n\r\nWhether you should hire a freelancer or a full-time employee depends greatly on the current needs of your business. Just starting up and need to keep costs down? A freelancer (or multiple freelancers) who can tackle tasks at a lower price point is probably the way to go. Have a more established small business looking to cement itself in the industry and grow sustainably? An investment in full-time workers will trump short-term contract hires.\r\n\r\nEither way, your business will suffer if you don’t consistently evaluate your decisions and determine when each type of talent makes the most sense for you. Keep an eye on your bottom line and you’ll have a better idea of when to go freelancer and when to go full-time.","comment":"how to decied"}

Much of the multi‐tasking investigations so far have been focusing on personal computers. However, smartphone technologies may even further encourage people to engage in media multi‐tasking through high rates of incoming prompts from emails, direct messages and social media notifications occurring while both using and not using the device. Thus, along with determining long‐term consequences of media multi‐tasking, future research should examine how the constant multi‐tasking made possible by Internet‐enabled mobile devices may impact daily functioning through acute but high frequency effects.","comment":"I think Apple was wise to delay and implement multi-tasking features as they have."}

{"created":1618241682282,"url":"youtube.com/watch?v=sAOazzU12go","quote":"Why Sperm Whale Poop Is Worth More Than Gold","comment":"Hi there.\nWhat is ounce for ounce more valueable than gold?\nSince you probably read the title you should already know the answer.\nTodays video is about spermwhale poop.\nMore specifically about ambergris - which isnt regular whale dung but a very special\nkind of substance that is the result of an astonishing decade-long journey.\nThe journey of this piece started a long time ago in the deepest parts of our oceans, thousands\nof feed below the surface in the mouth of an animal that is about as mysterious as the\nhabitat it lives in.\nThe Giant Squid.\nAs swift as an arrow, up to 10m(32ft) long and armed with 8 arms and 2 additional feeding\ntentacles, each of which riddled with hundrets of serrated sucker rings these giants are\nwithout a doubt one of the most successfull predators of the deep.\nThey process their food with a razor-sharp parrot-like beak at the center of their tentacles,\ncapable of cutting even the toughest catch into bite-sized pieces.\nBut even all of this cant protect them from the biggest toothed predator on the planet\n- the sperm whale.\nThese whales have specialized in hunting these and other deep sea squids - but how exactly\nthey do this is still mostly a mystery.\nIt was once hypothesised that they used their powerful ultrasound clicks to stun their prey.\nAfter all, at up to 235 decibels these clicks are the most powerful biological sounds in\nthe animal kingdom and would be intense enough to cause permant hearing loss and even potentiall\ndeadly lung ruptures if they were at a frequency humans could hear.\nExperiments, however, have shown that these clicks not only not stun squids, squids seem\nto not even be able to detect them.\nInstead spermwhales seems to only use them to locate their pray when hunting.\nFirst with broad loud long-range clicks to scan their sourrounds and then after identifying\na target with a more focussed beam of clicks.\nThe closer they get to their prey the faster and quiter these clicks become.\nThe significantly increased click rate during the last few meters of their appraoch, also\ncalled the buzz, likey enhances the resolution and allows for nearly realtime updates of\nthe prey location.\nhow the sperm whale can keep track of the squid when it drops below the sonar beam and\nuntil it reaches the mouth is however, still a mystery.\nonce in reach of the mouth the whales likely use suction feeding to catch the prey, similarly\nto dolphins and beaked whales.\nAll these animals can create a powerful suction through rapid movements in head, neck muscles\nand mouth regions also called jerks which they use to quite litearlly vacuum in their\npray.\nStill, given that these battles take place thousands of meters beneath the ocean surface\nis really difficult for scientists to shed a light on them.\nhow exactly these giants hunt the immensense amounts of squid they need is depite the progess\nof recent years still poorly understood.\nWeighing up to 60 metric tons(63 tons) an adult spermwhale roughly needs one metric\nton (1.1 tons) of food per day.\nThis is about as much as one african elephant bull a week.\nSo its not surprising that at any given time you can find the remains of one thousand and\nmore squids in the 4 stomachs of a sperm whales which consequently also means thousands of\nindegestable beaks as well as the pens and eyelenses of the squids which are also indigestable.\nThese items are normally vomited into the ocean when they fill up the stomach to a certain\npoint.\nThis happens in intervals of about 7-10 days and is similarly to cats vomiting hair balls,\ncompletely normal.\nIn rare cases, however - scientists belief it only occurs in 1 out of 100 spermwhales\n- this progress doesnt work like its supposed to.\nInstead, large amounts of these materials accumulate in the last stomach where they\ncongregate into a large undigestible mass of squid beaks, squid pens and parasitic worms,\nwhich are found in just about all whale stomachs.\nEventually parts of this mass - which cant be vomitted anymore - will leak into the intestine.\nWhat exactly happens to the lump there is still debated.\nThe best theory is that while mass is slowly carried through the intestine it gets together\nwith feces engulfed by a wax-like substance secreted to protect the whales digestive systems\nfrom the sharp objects.\nSmaller chunks are probably excreted and find their way into the ocean that way but if the\nmass is too large already it builds up infront of the rectum and cannot be passed.\nBecause the intestines of sperm whales arent meant for solid feces the sphincter muscle\nsimply cant relax sufficiently enough.\nAt the beginning however this isnt a severe problem.\nthorugh a local increase in tension and water-absorbing capacity the lump get compressed and shaped\ninto a smooth round clump that hampers defecation but doesnt completely prevent it.\nScientists believe sperm whales can live years maybe even decades with such a boulder before\nit becomes life-threateing.\nBut because over time the lump grows larger and larger as layer by layer more fecal matter\nand more of the waxy substance are added to it eventually the walls of the rectum become\nso distended that they rupture, which inevitably kills the whale.\nIn this case sharks and other scavangers will release the ambergris into the sea.\nBut this is only the beginning of its journey.\nfor the the fresh lump to transform from the soft, brown, fecal-smelling rough diamond\ninto one for the most valueble natural substances in the world it takes years sometimes even\ndecades in the ocean, during which the boulder ages like a fine wine.\nOver time sunlight salt and water as well as bacteria and enzymes on the inside of the\nlump change its molecular structure, clean and dry it.\nThe endresult is a much smaller and lighter lump with a pale grey or yellowish color that\ncould easily be mistaken for a stone when held in hand and posseses only a slight yet\ndistinctive scent.\nAmbergris is usually found washed up on the beach either by lucky walkers or by professional\nambergris hunters.\nBut fishermen too find these strange lumps in their nets from time to time.\nOf course its usually quite the surprise when people find out just how valuebale the find\nreally is.\nBut what exactly is it that makes Ambergris so valueable?\nThe main reason is of course its rarity - after years in the intestines of just a few sperm\nwhales and possibly decades on the open ocean the chances to find even one lump are understandebly\nsmall.\nThis, together with its high demand, particularly by high end perfume makers, explains why its\nstill on of the most expensive and sought after materials.\nAmbergris has been prized for over a thousand years because of its distinctive smell and\ntaste and its alleged medicinal properties The Greek supposedly added it to their wine\nand the aztec to their tobacco.\nDuring the middle ages in Europe it was used as as medication for headaches, colds, epilepsy.\nIt was even believed sniffing amberergris would protect you from the plague.\nKing Charles II reportatly loved eating it on eggs and in Aegypt it was added to coffee\nas an aphrodisiac.\nIn Asia Ambergris was traded like spices, burned in religious ceremonies and used in\ntraditional medicine.\nBut most notably it was, and still is, prized by perfume makers all over the world for its\nmarine, animalistic and sweet scent but espeically for its ability to make scents last longer,\nwhich is probably the most important criterium of a good perfume.\nToday, however, because of its incredibly rarity and the legal problems it presents\nmost perfume makers have switched to synthetic alternatives but a few high-end perfume brands\nlike chanel still use it to this day.\nWhat makes Ambergris problematic legally is that when commercial whaling was outlawed\nin many parts of the world, the possession and trade of whale products, which sometimes\nincluded ambergris, was simililarly outlawed.\nFor example in the United States.\nThis is despite the fact that that ambergris cant really be harvested from dead whales,\nfor the reasons mentioned earlier.\nDespite these restrictions, the demand is still high for the floading gold which means\nthat the few pieces found each year continue to be traded for rediculous amounts.\nDepending on the quality and the age of the lump gram prices usually range between $20\nto $50 which means Sperm whale poop is still one of the most valueable substances on the\nplanet.\nIn 2006, a couple walking on the beach in Australia found a chunk of ambergris weighing\nover 14kg(30lbs), which netted them $300.000.\nIn 2013, a dog walker found a 2.7kg(6lbs) lump washed up on a British beach that was\nvalued by experts at up to $200.000 But the most astonishing find of recent times\nmade three Omani fishermen when they scooped an 80kg(180lbs) piece of ambergris out of\nthe ocean that was values at $2.5 million - $3 million.\nGiven the sums involved these stories usally get picked up by local news outlets.\nSadly however, most of the resulting articles continue to spread the popular misconception\nthat ambergris is whale vomit - an early hypothesis for the origins of these lumps that can be\nruled out almost entirely today.\nBefore commercial whaling revealed the true origins of ambergris, people had many explanations\nfor where it came from or what it was.\nOriginally It was believed ambergris and amber both came from tree sap, hence the similar\nnames.\nOther early explanations included bird droppings, dried sea foam or sea mushrooms, beehives\nthat had fallen into the ocean and crocodile droppings\nSo, if you ever walk across the beach and stumble across a stone that has no earthly\nbusiness being there - a stone that feels slighty too light for its size and has a strange\nscent you've never smeller before.\nRemember to take it home with you.\nThanks for watching"}

Each component is explained below as follows:\r\nData Block\r\n\r\nIt can be described as a sequence of blocks interconnecting each newly updated block to its previous block until it gets linked back to its genesis block to create a secure chain. This prevents any risk of modification as each block is strongly linked to the previous one using a hash label, which builds a robust link between blocks [26].\r\nDistributed Ledger\r\n\r\nIt is also known as a database that records and stores transactions generated by users. Each transaction contains a unique cryptographic signature decoupled with a timestamp, thereby making the ledger resistant to alterations. Furthermore, this ledger is shared across all members of the network simultaneously so that users are updated in real time.\r\nConsensus Algorithm\r\n\r\nNo entity should be able to control the process of transacting a block over the chain so that each block is managed by all members who share equal rights to overcome security problems such as double-spending. This is achieved through the process known as consensus. From the blockchain’s point of view, the consensus process establishes an agreement among entities regarding the validation of each data block. This is achieved by nodes joining in the mining process and competing with one another to verify the block to receive a fee as a reward in return for their mining effort. For example, Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to manage its transactions, while Ethereum uses proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm. Also, there are various other algorithms as well, such as the Byzantine faulty tolerant (BFT) algorithm","comment":"explaining blockchain"}

She separates mouse mothers from their pups at unpredictable intervals and further disrupts parenting by confining the mothers in tubes or dropping them in water, both stressful experiences for mice. When the mothers return to the cage and their pups, they're frantic and distracted. They often ignore the pups, compounding the stress of the separation on their offspring.\n\nMansuy says the mice's suffering has a purpose. \"We're applying a paradigm that is inspired by human conditions,\" she says. \"We're doing it to gain understanding for better child health.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, the pups of stressed mothers displayed altered behavior as adults. But to Mansuy's surprise, the behavioral changes persisted in the offspring's offspring. Initially, she thought this could be a result of the offspring's own behavior: Mice traumatized as pups could have been bad parents, replicating the neglect they experienced in childhood. Thus they might simply be passing on a behavioral legacy—the same lasting psychological effect that might explain such findings in humans.\n\nTo rule out that possibility, Mansuy studied only the male line, breeding untraumatized, \"naïve\" female mice with traumatized males, and then removing males from the mother's cage so that their behavior did not impact their offspring. After weaning, she raised the mice in mixed groups to prevent litter mates from reinforcing each other's behaviors.\n\nHer lab repeated the procedure, sometimes going out six generations. \"It worked immediately,\" she says of the protocol. \"We could see that there were symptoms [in descendants] that were similar to the animals that were themselves separated.\" Descendants of stressed fathers displayed more risk-taking behavior, like exploring exposed areas of a platform suspended off the ground. When dropped in water, they \"gave up\" and stopped swimming sooner than control mice, an indicator of depressivelike behavior in mice.","comment":""}

Even the most traditional businesses will need to adopt things like digital menus and online booking.”\n\n“There’s a need to solve these problems for our local communities,” Victoria Buchanan agreed, adding that the hospitality industry is currently “reinventing experiences”. “We’re having to make massive transformation steps here. People are having to think fast and be innovative.”\n\nShe talked about the changes that fine dining is currently undergoing, with restaurants paring down their offerings to the most high-quality drinks and taster menus – people are going out less, but when they do they spend more money, which results in a higher level of revenue for restaurants overall.\n\nSimone Ippolito agreed with this observation, adding that businesses “need to be smart and see how the world is changing.”\n\nHowever, Buchanan noted that it isn’t always necessary for hospitality businesses to completely overhaul their offering or reinvent their way of operating; there are opportunities present in the product offerings and services that they already have. For example, bars can create content that shows their customers how to make their own drinks at home.\n\n“You don’t need to invest in huge transformation to start communicating with your clients,” she said. “You can make the stuff that you’ve got out there work a lot harder.”","comment":""}

(I've often deplored the differences in behavior between Word and Excel, which sometimes seem to be from different planets, despite being sold together as a package deal!) But while we can hope that key productivity applications will eventually merge (and not in the way of the dreaded OpenOffice), I expect that there will always be a lively trade in applications that cater to special areas, be they games, instant messaging, or video editing.","comment":"Umm...

If you don’t explicitly define your structure, then you are left with an implicit one, and that can stifle productivity. We had hoped that being flat would let us move faster and be more creative, but as we grew, we ended up with an unspoken hierarchy that actually slowed down our ability to execute.\n\n…\n\nAn org chart is a map of the growing organism that is your company.

Well, what that means in our eyes, if translated to a home workshop, would be like saying that you can't require the operating human to know how to adjust his tools, or set up jigs, or change drill sizes, and the like. You can see there that these skills are easy to learn in the context of what the human has to learn anyway about using the tools, and that they provide for much greater flexibility in finding convenient ways to use the tools to help shape materials.","comment":"Must be able to shape our tools to us"}

This seemed like a good idea in theory. But when they went to roll out their untested collage of practices, no one would implement them.\n\nWhy? There were no real-world examples of where that whole model had been implemented and was working in practice. Without a working model to replicate, no one would trust the new model on faith alone. Sutton and Rao go on to tell a different story about howKaiser Permanente successfully rolled out a large technology change in a different way. Instead of trying to change things for all groups at once, they rolled out the new product piecemeal, in small, safer markets to prove the change was beneficial, before expanding it to even more people.\n\nThe key lesson here: People need a new template to copy.","comment":""}

The brain predicted that everything would remain as it was, or would change in foreseeable ways, and when that didn’t happen error signals resulted. As long as the predictions were correct, there was no news.

This mixing of distributions will smooth out any one distribution’s specific characteristics and, in aggregate, will result in an even, uniform distribution that causes Benford’s Law to arise. One thing to note at this point is that, given that our entire assumption is based on the notion of layered randomness, we cannot try to apply Benford’s to a set of data which we know will follow a certain form or distribution such as the heights or IQs of a population which should be normal and all of similar scales of magnitude.","comment":"Paragraph break somewhere; this runs a little long."}

Ego is just modern terminology for attachment. Attachment is essentially attachment to one's own apparent existence. We think we exist as static entities. We fear not existing. So in each moment we try to reconfirm our existence in terms of \"other\". \"I like this.\" \"I hate that.\" \"I couldn't care less.\" Passion, aggression and ignorance. You should be able to see that if you meditate. If you define the problem as \"ego\" locked in battle against \"you\", then you'll end up always wrestling with your motives, unable to figure out for sure which one is ego and which one is you. Why? Because neither really exists.\n\nDissatisfaction itself is self-confirmation. There's an interesting example of that in the Buddhist realm of pretas or hungry ghosts. Hungry ghost realm is one of the 6 realms of rebirth. It represents passion. It's taught that a preta is a being with a giant stomach but a tiny throat. It sees a cool stream ahead to quench its thirst, but when it gets there the stream turns out to be pus and sand. It sees a wonderful feast, but when it tries to eat the feast turns out to be shit and garbage. That's a metaphorical portrayal of passion. It shows a critical point: The object of desire is not the motive. The wanting itself is the motive. Once you get the object of desire it falls flat. There's no true satisfaction. The wanting is what makes you feel alive. Dissatisfaction seems like displeasure but actually we feel directionless and empty without it. So it all boils down to working on non-attachment. We don't crave because \"ego\" is demanding things from us. We crave because we can't tolerate the spaciousness -- the non-confirmation -- of non-ego.\n\nThat may seem semantic, but it's more workable to watch your mind and simply endeavor to drop attachment in the moment than it is to objectify attachment as an external, enemy entity that you must defeat.","comment":""}

Safe Stay hotels have \"enhanced\" cleaning standards throughout the hotel, use cleaning products with a higher concentration of bacteria-killing ingredients and encourage their staff to practice social distancing. The initiative will \"ensure greater transparency and confidence\" for guests, according to Chip Rogers, president of AHLA.\n\n\nBut how do you know if your hotel room is actually clean? It's not that easy, say experts. \n\n\"There is no road map and, frankly, no 100% agreement on the science and health concerns,\" says Carolyn Richmond, a partner at Fox Rothschild's Hospitality Practice Group. \"While guests certainly want to see that cleaning policies and other protective measures have been taken, it has to be more than just window dressing.\"\n\nMany hotels are going beyond the new industry standards. For example, the Salishan Resort, a golf hotel on the Oregon coast, has introduced stringent new cleaning measures. They include new health screenings for employees and the installation of touchless processes to reduce direct interaction with guests whenever possible. \n\n\"We've even created fitness guest rooms with their own dedicated, sanitized Peloton and TRX workout equipment,\" says Ken Cruse, president of SCP Hotels, which owns the Salishan Resort.\n\nHow do you know the hotel room is virus-free?\n\nBut then how do you know if a hotel room is clean? You can ask an expert. Travel agents keep lists of the cleanest hotels, based on their inspections and familiarity with properties. \n\n\"Our agency has a list of preferred hotels in each city based on past cleanliness, current mandatory hygiene precautions and following updated virus regulations,\" says Sangeeta Sadarangani, CEO of Crossing, a multi-national travel agency headquartered in London.\n\nFor example, hotels that have already started accepting guests in Hong Kong are following a weekly deep-clean policy. They're using sanitizing sprays in the rooms. Restaurant staff use gloves and face masks, even when they aren't on duty. Linens and towels are changed daily.\n\nGuests and experts also recommend that you read hotel reviews from a variety of sources, including travel review sites, blogs and social media. Don't limit yourself to just one source.\n\n","comment":""}

Does the weather condition have any effect on the delay of the train? Or more related to our current situation, does mask-wearing help stop the spread of coronavirus? To understand these questions, many of us will think of hypothesis testing in the first place. Indeed, hypothesis testing is one of the most widely used statistical methods to understand whether the observed data supports an idea, or more specifically, a hypothesis. Sometimes, a seemingly obvious idea may be very difficult to test. For example, the hypothesis that mask-wearing is saving lives is intuitively correct given that masks can decrease virus exposure and thus decrease toxicity. However, it is not easy to test it due to a lot of confounding factors (e.g. sex, age, etc.). With a lot of effort, now there is much rigorous scientific evidence supporting this hypothesis.","comment":"Good opening paragraph."}

I know you and I disagree here on the importance of credentials and while I 100% agree that having a fancy education or working at one of the big studios is not a guarantee of intelligence or ability, I do think that it's worth trying to find a head of production/COO that's competent AND that comes from Disney, Pixar, Ghibli, Dreamworks or one of the other top studios. Someone who's already been written up in past press releases or in Cartoon Brew. IF you ever decide to raise capital, it would more or less be a requirement given how unimpressive your existing exec team is in terms of credentials or public reputation or clout.."}

Crucially, the Internet seems to bypass the “transactional” aspect that is inherent to other forms of cognitive offloading in two ways. First, the Internet does not place any responsibility on the user to retain unique information for others to draw upon (as would typically be required in human societies)45. Second, unlike other transactive memory stores, the Internet acts as a single entity that is responsible for holding and retrieving virtually all factual information, and thus does not require individuals to remember what exact information is externally stored, or even where it is located. In this way, the Internet is becoming a “supernormal stimulus”46 for transactive memory – making all other options for cognitive offloading (including books, friends, community) become redundant, as they are outcompeted by the novel capabilities for external information storage and retrieval made possible by the Internet.","comment":""}

It should be held for about two to four hours outside the office.\nNo End Runs: Employees, specifically the Visionary and Integrator, should avoid End Runs. These are situations where one bypasses their manager to complain to get a better or different answer to their problem. These actions can cause the Visionary and Integrator to interfere with the effectiveness of the other.\nIntegrators Break Ties: Decision making should be pushed down to the lowest person responsible, with the integrator handling day-to-day issues between departments. Also, when the Visionary and Integrator disagree, the Integrator decides as they are more aware of priorities, problems, and resources.\nWorking ‘In’ vs. ‘On’ the Business: When you are working ‘in’ the business, you are an employee. As an owner, you have a different role, as you work ‘on’ the company. Visionaries and Int Owners can feel entitled to make internal decisions, which can confuse. Owners should allow their employees to execute in their appropriate roles.\nMaintain Mutual Respect: The Visionary and Integrator have to respect each other authentically.

Afterall society should not dictate how much everyone should get. If they're smart, hard working and lucky enough they earned whatever they can make. \n\nAlthough this holds truth, and can seem fair from a libertarian POV, it does not mean that it is universally fair, nor does it get us to the best possible result as a society overall. \nAs we can see in his \"exhibit A\" it wrecks havoc in society and robs families off their earnings while the highest paying CEOs get away with minuscule fines and millions in rewards. \nIs that fair?\n\nGoverments now need to step up to prevent even more damage from corporate institutions that have become too big to fail. As a result they implement more rules, more government and more frustration for libertarians. \n\nIt's a vicious cycle of destruction, and it seems as if Peter is not really seeing the part that libertarian economics play here.\nIs there a middle ground we can walk?

We’d meet again the following Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and then the board team would pitch their episode to the network on Friday. After addressing any network notes, the team would spend three weeks cleaning up the board, and then we’d go in and record it with the actors. It would then move into animatic, where we can edit the dialogue tracks in with the storyboard. Steve and I would work with an editor and a timing director for a week to work out the pacing of the show, and as the seasons went on Steve and I would do more and more of our rewriting in the animatic.

{"created":1605703686207,"url":"theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/17/british-government-food-shortage-uk-fresh-europe-ports-storage-space","quote":"A few days ago, I carried out a small experiment. I sent almost identical requests to two government departments.\n\nIs Britain really about to embrace chaos and misery for the sake of Brexit dogma?\nWill Hutton\n\nRead more\nI asked the business department whether the UK holds strategic oil reserves. Yes: the UK keeps stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports. I asked the environment department whether the UK holds strategic food reserves. No: they aren’t necessary, because “the UK has a highly resilient food supply chain”. The government treats oil as a strategic asset but food as a matter for the market.\n\nSo what happens if our “highly resilient food supply chain” breaks after Brexit transition, on 1 January? It won’t, the government promised. “Our risk assessments show there will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK,” whether or not there’s a deal. But when I pressed it to show me these risk assessments, the plural turned out to be misleading. There’s just one assessment: a “reasonable worst-case scenario” for the UK’s borders.\n\nThis is grim enough. It suggests that the flow of freight through the ports could be reduced by between 20% and 40%, while trucks travelling in either direction could be delayed by up to two days: a big problem for fresh food. This month, the National Audit Office reviewed the government’s border arrangements, and found them to be late, untested, “inherently complex”, “high-risk” and “very challenging”. The government’s brinkmanship, intended to wrongfoot the EU, has instead wrongfooted our own hauliers and traders, who have been unable to prepare with confidence.\n\nSo far, so bad. But the UK’s border is only one link in the food supply chain, and it may not be the weakest. If the ports are congested and the flow of goods reduced, we will need stocks to bridge the gap. Food traders will have to build reserves, now and in December, to cover the likely shortfall in January. This means warehouse capacity. One minor hitch: there isn’t any.\n\nBecause of the shift to online sales caused by the pandemic, and the need to store protective equipment, much of the spare capacity was mopped up before the second lockdown. Now, because nonessential shops are closed, plenty of stock is stuck in warehouses. Any remaining space has been swallowed by Christmas: tinsel, toys and turkeys. Goods for the domestic market will have to compete for warehouse space with goods for export, as traders expect snarl-ups in both directions.\n\nA survey by the UK Warehousing Association found that there is less than 3% spare capacity nationwide. Most of this consists of small corners, useless for major wholesalers. The association believes “the situation will quickly become critical”.\n\nWhile the government has spent £1.4bn this year on border arrangements that would usually be made by the private sector, it has done nothing to ensure there is sufficient storage space, or that food is prioritised. Such issues, it believes, are best left to business.\n\nBut its confidence in the food industry is not shared by the industry itself. In October, the chair of Tesco warned of fresh food shortages for “a few weeks, possibly a few months” after 1 January. The UK imports 62% of its fresh food, much of it from Europe. We rely on European trade for most of our onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and salad, and for a critical portion of many other vegetables and fruits. In the dead of winter, with trucks stuck at the border, possible tariffs, a weaker pound and no warehouse space, the price of fresh produce could go through the roof. If you can find it at all.\n\nLast year, before the transition deadline was extended, the government did conduct wider risk assessments. When they were leaked, we discovered that it foresaw “potential consumer panic and food shortages”. This year, though the situation is greatly complicated by the pandemic, it seems to have decided that it’s best not to ask.\n\nIs the problem confined to fresh food? With neither strategic food reserves nor a strategic risk assessment of warehouse capacity, I’m beginning to wonder. Without testing every link in the chain, the government has no grounds for dismissing the threat of an overall shortage. While it now seems almost certain that we will face a dearth of fresh fruit and vegetables, could there also be deficits of some kinds of frozen, tinned and dried food?\n\nAlready, thanks to a combination of austerity and the coronavirus, plenty of people in the UK struggle to afford a good diet. According to the UN, a healthy diet costs five times as much as one that is merely adequate in terms of calories. The number of people using foodbanks this year has risen by nearly a half. Any interruption of supply will hit those in poverty first, and worst.\n\nWhen the government was challenged on this issue in parliament last year, it claimed it was “not responsible for the supply of food and drink to the population in an emergency”. That is up to “the industry”. In other words, little has changed since the Irish famine of the 1840s and the Indian famines of the 1870s. It’s the same reckless, uncaring attitude that has helped kill 50,000 people in the pandemic.\n\nBecause we are leaving the single market and the customs union, the disruption is likely to be brutal, whether or not a deal is struck. If Brexit causes further economic rupture, the shops are half-empty and even the foodbanks can’t find enough supplies, there is a real prospect of chronic hunger. But search as you may, you will find no one in government who gives a damn.","comment":""}

Here are three ideas to get you thinking about ways to earn revenue beyond your usual guests. We are not saying these are easy or possible, but change brings new markets and early adopters. We expect to see new business verticals created in the rooms segment in the short-term, some of which may stay around when the Covid 19 pandemic subsides.\n\nConsider offering a special rate for people who want to self-isolate in comfort and away from family or friends. Offering a lower rate shows compassion and helps affected people out. The catchment area for this is likely the city you are, or sub area of a city. With travel limited, and risks, people will want to walk, cycle or drive to the hotel.\n\nPeople are going to get bored being at home. Can you offer something they have not got at home in a safe way? Hotels with in-room gaming, amazing beds, super views, coffee / tea on tap - all have something that, if people feel safe and it's close to their home, or in short driving distance and the price is right they might consider for a night or two. The key here is to to the local community - people are not going to be going to the cinema.\n\nCompanies may discover staff do not have suitable home working conditions. Are your rooms work friendly, with good desks, lighting, seating and wifi? Can you provide a safe and better work environment for their their staff, which is better than they have at home. Productivity may become an issue and companies may be looking to pay to achieve that and have happier staff. Offering day rates for workers could bring in covering revenue.","comment":""}

The aim was to prevent internalised negativity building up because that prevented them making progress. Sharing was accompanied by listening and taking action to address and reduce frustrations. The individuals therefore worked better, beef didn’t build and they understood and trusted each other. So, we took that idea, introduced it as a weekly session and I loved it.

{"created":1606696270940,"url":"uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis?source=see_link&topicRef=111177","quote":"SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n●Patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) have persistent pain which significantly impairs functionality, activity participation, and quality of life. This is in contrast to patients with mild knee OA who have low levels of or intermittent knee pain with relatively preserved joint function and quality of life. (See 'Definitions' above.)\n\n●In all patients with moderate to severe knee OA, we suggest exercise for pain relief and joint protection (algorithm 1) (Grade 2C). Aquatic exercise has been associated with reduced rates of adverse events compared with land-based exercises and is a good option for patients with moderate to severe pain due to the lower load to the knees. (See 'Exercise' above.)\n\n●In patients with moderate to severe medial tibiofemoral (TF) OA, we suggest use of a valgus (or unloader) knee brace as an adjunct to other core treatments (Grade 2C). Patients with medial TF OA who are more physically active and usually younger may experience greater improvements with unloader knee bracing. (See 'Knee braces' above.)\n\n●In patients with significant mobility and/or balance impairments, a history of falls, and/or moderate to severe pain resistant to other treatment options, we suggest a walking stick (cane) in the contralateral (unaffected side) (Grade 2C). (See 'Walking aids' above.)\n\n●We refer patients for psychological interventions for pain-coping skills training if appropriate and if the service is available. (See 'Psychological interventions' above.)\n\n●In patients with moderate to severe knee OA or who have symptomatic OA in multiple joints (eg, hip and spine), we suggest oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), preferably at the lowest dose and shortest duration possible (Grade 2B). The choice of NSAID is based upon a variety of factors including adverse effect profile, patient comorbidities, cost to patient, and patient preference regarding frequency of administration. (See 'Oral NSAIDs' above.)\n\n●For patients with OA in multiple joints and concomitant comorbidities that may contraindicate oral NSAIDs and/or those who have not responded satisfactorily to NSAIDs, we suggest duloxetine 60 to 120 mg daily (Grade 2B). We start with a lower initial dose of 30 mg and gradually increase to improve tolerability. (See 'Duloxetine' above.)\n\n●We suggest not routinely using intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for patients with knee OA (Grade 2C). We limit the use of intraarticular injections to patients with moderate to severe pain and contraindications to or failure of other treatment options who are seeking short-term pain relief. (See 'Limited role of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections' above.)\n\n●We refer patients to surgery when significant joint-related symptoms persist despite the use of nonsurgical interventions. (See 'Surgery' above.)\n\n●There are several approaches that have been used to treat patients with knee OA that we generally do not recommend due to lack of data demonstrating efficacy. These include insoles and footwear, opioids, hyaluronans, platelet-rich plasma, acetaminophen, glucosamine and chondroitin, other nutritional supplements, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and acupuncture. (See \"Management of knee osteoarthritis\", section on 'Therapies lacking efficacy or of uncertain benefit'.)\n\n","comment":""}

A young orphan, Earwig, grows up as a beloved ward in St. Morwald’s Home for Children after having been dropped off in a basket by her mother as a baby. Earwig is transparently manipulative in a way that is more annoying than plucky; unlike other beloved Ghibli protagonists, she fails to mature. When the movie’s coupled characters Bella Yaga and the Mandrake come to “pick out” a child, Earwig does her best to avoid being adopted but is nevertheless chosen. The couple soon reveal themselves as magical creatures and entrap the child in their cottage to do chores all day long. \n\nEarwig’s story is, from this point on, completely confined to their home as she tries to figure out ways to charm her captors. The movie is billed as musically focused, with a kind of ‘70s British rock aesthetic lurking in the world building, though this never really develops.

But it’s not obvious that a theory emphasizing the uncertainty of perception—the way that the brain has to infer what is outside rather than straightforwardly taking it in—is a theory of oneness. To another philosopher who had taken an interest in predictive processing—Jakob Hohwy, who taught at Monash University, in Melbourne—the theory emphasized, on the contrary, how very difficult it was for the brain to understand things outside itself. Clark saw the brain as travelling light, taking in only the news, only what it needed for its next move; but Hohwy saw how much heavy mental equipment was necessary to process even the briefest glance or touch. He wrote an essay for a forthcoming book titled “Andy Clark and His Critics,” in which he proposed a counter-metaphor to Clark’s joyful surfer: Nosferatu. The brain was like a vampire, shut in a coffin.","comment":""}

Touching as a concept for feminist knowledge production is a response to Donna Haraway's critique of the ”Godtrick”; a detached and disembodied vision from nowhere as the dominant way of producing scientific knowledge [32]. In menstrual tracking technologies, self-knowledge is created through algorithmic processes of the body [21], which merely encourages one to observe the menstruating body through data on the screen: a disembodied vision from nowhere. Instead of producing knowledge by observing the world through vision, Puig de la Bellacasa proposes touching as a material and affective methodology. In contrast, menstrual technologies are designed within a world where societal stigma influences people who menstruate to conceal and avoid their menstruating body—as expressed in recommendations for menstrual apps to ”be discreet by default or provide a neutral non-obvious interface option” [21]—thus menstrual technologies are avoiding the intimacy, care, and knowledge implied in touch as far as possible.

As well as the Emmy-award winning Big Mouth, it is the studio behind another cult Netflix show, The Midnight Gospel, a psychedelic jaunt based on the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. For CBS All Access, Titmouse has produced Star Trek: Lower Decks ; another show for the network, The Harper House, about a down-and-out family, is in production. Then there is The Legend of Vox Machina, an animated show based on Critical Role, the Dungeon & Dragons role-playing web series, which is due to stream on Amazon Prime. In January 2020, Titmouse signed a multi-year deal with Netflix to produce more adult animated series, but it is only just dawning on Chris and Shannon that the studio may actually be “big”. “We used to shoot from the hip,” says Chris. “Now we have to be slightly more adult with our decision making.”","comment":""}

For example, if I have two macros triggered by Cmd+S called \"high\" and \"him\" then you'd need to type \"hig\" to trigger the first.\n\n","comment":""}

We want to combine the extraordinary customer-serving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement, nimbleness, and risk-acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start-ups.\n\nCan we do it? I’m optimistic. We have a good start on it, and I think our culture puts us in a position to achieve the goal. But I don’t think it’ll be easy. There are some subtle traps that even high-performing large organizations can fall into as a matter of course, and we’ll have to learn as an institution how to guard against them. One common pitfall for large organizations – one that hurts speed and inventiveness – is “one-size-fits-all” decision making.\n\nSome decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.\n\nAs organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.1 We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.\n\nAnd one-size-fits-all thinking will turn out to be only one of the pitfalls. We’ll work hard to avoid it… and any other large organization maladies we can identify.\n\nSustainability and Social Invention\n\nOur growth has happened fast. Twenty years ago, I was driving boxes to the post office in my Chevy Blazer and dreaming of a forklift. In absolute numbers (as opposed to percentages), the past few years have been especially significant. We’ve grown from 30,000 employees in 2010 to more than 230,000 now. We’re a bit like parents who look around one day and realize their kids are grown – you blink and it happens.\n\nOne thing that’s exciting about our current scale is that we can put our inventive culture to work on moving the needle on sustainability and social issues.\n\nTwo years ago we set a long-term goal to use 100% renewable energy across our global AWS infrastructure. We’ve since announced four significant wind and solar farms that will deliver 1.6 million megawatt hours per\n\n \n\n1 \tThe opposite situation is less interesting and there is undoubtedly some survivorship bias. Any companies that habitually use the light-weight Type 2 decision-making process to make Type 1 decisions go extinct before they get large.","comment":""}

It is impossible to forget that you're holding the LEAP key down (this has something to do with the part of our nervous system that keeps track of which muscles are used), so you can't forget the mode you're in.

Le prendre au sérieux afin de lui prouver qu’il a tort, ou choisir de s’en moquer ?\n\nC’est une question compliquée, car elle relève de la vie sociale ordinaire, à la discrétion de chacun, et il serait hasardeux de penser qu’il n’y a qu’une seule bonne manière de s’y prendre. A première vue, on pourrait penser qu’écouter avec bienveillance un proche aux propos complotistes pourrait être une façon efficace de gérer le problème en famille. Mais ce faisant, on normalise le complotiste, qui a en fait besoin de contradicteurs pour exister… En prenant ses propos aux sérieux, vous l’aurez crédibilisé. A l’inverse, la moquerie et a fortiori l’humiliation peuvent avoir un effet contre-productif, et justifier sa position de victime, d’outsider. Car le complotiste sait bien que sa position n’est pas mainstream, qu’elle est stigmatisée. C’est même dans l’opposition que se construit cette position. Le complotiste est, dans une certaine mesure, immunisé contre l’argumentation et la moquerie, car il peut se nourrir des deux. C’est ce qui en fait une posture si difficile à pénétrer.","comment":""}

For the purpose of survival, what was needed was not a complete picture of the world but a useful one—one that guided action.

Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. For example, in a closed book test, a test taker is usually required to rely upon memory to respond to specific items whereas in an open book test, a test taker may use one or more supplementary tools such as a reference book or calculator when responding. A test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal test is a reading test administered by a parent to a child. A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an I.Q. test administered by a psychologist in a clinic. Formal testing often results in a grade or a test score.[2] A test score may be interpreted with regards to a norm or criterion, or occasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis of a large number of participants. An exam is meant to test a persons knowledge or willingness to give time to manipulate that subject.\n\n","comment":""}

Whereas these can be adaptive and beneficial under regular environmental conditions112, this implicit cognitive process can also be hijacked by the artificial environmental manufactured on social media113, 114, which showcases hyper‐successful individuals constantly putting their best foot forward, and even using digital manipulation of images to inflate physical attractiveness. By facilitating exposure to these drastically upward social comparisons (which would rarely be encountered in everyday life), online social media can produce unrealistic expectations of oneself – leading to poor body image and negative self‐concept, particularly for younger people107, 111, 115, 116. For instance, in adolescents (particularly females), those who spent more time on social media and smartphones have a greater prevalence of mental health problems, including depression, than those who spent more time on “non‐screen” activities116, with greater than 5 hrs/day (versus 1 hr/day) associated with a 66% increased risk of one suicide‐related outcome","comment":""}

What we call “storyboard directors” are actually “storyboard writers.” We have a group of writers who do the premises and the outlines.

But the guys who actually do the rough drawings on the boards actually do all of the dialogue writing and most of the visual jokes. We call them directors, but really what they are are visual writers. They direct how the show is going to look in its visual form, and then that gets handed off. \n\nIt’s a different approach. Most shows will have a script, and they’ll give it to a storyboard director, and his job is to draw what’s in the script and then direct it.

But Mansuy couldn't find the same kinds of RNA changes that appeared in her lab's mice. That could be because the soldiers' samples were years old, or simply because mice and people are different, showing the limits of mouse models. But Mansuy hopes it means epigenetic changes are sensitive to the type of trauma and when it occurs in the life course. Mice can never perfectly replicate human suffering, but, she says, \"the best approach\" for research \"is to select a population of humans who have gone through conditions which are as similar as possible to our model.\"","comment":""}

This is especially apparent if our objective function is non-convex. Unlike gradient descent, which ensures that we’re always going downhill by always going in the direction opposite the gradient, Newton’s method fits a paraboloid to the local curvature and proceeds to move to the stationary point of that paraboloid. Depending on the local behavior of our initial point, Newton’s method could take us to a maximum or a saddle point instead of a minimum. This problem is exacerbated in higher dimensional non-convex functions, where saddle points are much more likely to occur compared to minimum points. We thus see that Newton’s method is really only appropriate for minimizing convex objective functions. The silver lining here, though, is that a considerable amount of optimization problems in machine learning are convex problems, such as linear (and ridge) regression, logisitic regression, and support vector machines. An obvious example of a non-convex model would be neural networks. For the rest of this article, we will restrict our attention to only convex objective functions. Correspondingly, we require the Hessian to be positive definite.","comment":"Excellent, key paragraph."}

Which is a lovely visual!\nPoint is, because of its consistency, it floats around at the top of the water, instead of sinking.\nAnd these floating, watery feces are packed full of iron because the whales don’t need\nall the stuff they get from those deep sea noms.\nAbout 90 percent of it gets pooped out. You know what does need iron? Plants.\nIt’s an essential nutrient for photosynthesis.\nSo all the tiny photosynthesizers that live in the ocean — collectively known as phytoplankton, love iron.\nThey don’t care if it’s from runny whale poop.\nIn fact, in some spots in the ocean, these tiny plants literally can’t get enough of the stuff.\nThe dissolved iron in the water is so low that it keeps their populations from growing. \nThat’s because they require a specific form of iron called iron 2 that can easily dissolve in water.\nAnd most iron 2 makes its way to the ocean via dust.\nSo places far from dusty lands, like the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica, are extremely low in dissolved iron.\nBut whales can help with that!\nWhales that live in low iron waters are like giant ocean crop dusters, fertilizing the water with their iron-rich poop.\nWhen a bunch of iron becomes available, the phytoplankton reproduce like it’s going out of style. \nThey can double their numbers in a single day, creating swirls of green visible from space! \nWe call this a bloom. These blooms do a bunch of photosynthesizing, so they build tons of sugar out of carbon dioxide and water. \nThat means they suck up lots of dissolved carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide that went into the water from the air. \nThese blooms end up feeding all sorts of ocean creatures, from microscopic animals to filter-feeding whales.\nEventually, though, all that yummy iron gets used up, and any phytoplankton that aren’t eaten die.\nAt this point, the carbon in their bodies could get broken down by microbes and return to the atmosphere as CO2. \nBut most of it sinks too quickly for that, so it ends up on the bottom of the ocean instead. \nAnd once it’s down there, it stays down there.\nThat carbon gets trapped for a really long time, like, thousands of years or more.\nSo, the ultimate effect of whales pooping is less carbon dioxide in our atmosphere!\nBut it couldn’t be that much, right?\nWell, in 2010, researchers actually crunched the numbers to figure out just how much carbon\nthe 12,000 sperm whales living in the Southern Ocean were helping store.\nThey found that while these whales breathe out around 160,000 tons of carbon per year,\ntheir poop fertilizes 400,000 tons of carbon storage.\nThat’s a net storage of 240,000 tons a year!\nNow, this is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions of tons of carbon humans pump into the air every year. \nSo Southern Ocean sperm whales aren’t making much of a dent in our climate problem all by themselves.\nBut they aren’t the only whales in the Southern Ocean, and researchers believe that other\nspecies found there may be doing the same thing. \nAlso, there used to be over one million sperm whales worldwide before commercial whaling.\nJust imagine the carbon storage potential if their populations rebounded to that level!\nAnd we’re working on that. \nSperm whales are currently protected in the US under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act,\nand listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\nAnd conservation groups continue to push for legislation to protect the animals, as well as\nencourage companies to adopt whale-safe fishing gear and shipping practices and reduce ocean noise pollution.\nSo, the whales are already doing their part to combat climate change.\nNow, thanks to science, we know that by helping them bounce back, we can do ours. \nAnd that’s not the only reason this kind of research is important! \nIt also helps us understand how ocean ecosystems function as a whole, and how quickly that\ndelicate balance can be disrupted. \nAnd that’s just plain old important science right there!\nThanks for watching this episode of SciShow!\nAnd thanks especially, to today’s sponsor, Brilliant. \nBrilliant strives to make learning fun, they also offer dozens of interactive STEM courses through their website and app.\nThey’ve got a really cool intro course on statistics, for instance, which shows you\nhow scientists make decisions with limited data.\nStatistics is one of the most important things in the world to understand!\nBut they’ve also got an entire library of math courses!\nSo you can learn how to best determine things like how much poop 12,000 whales make without\nfollowing them all around 24/7.\nYou can also get access to all of their 60-plus courses with an annual Premium subscription.\nAnd as a thank you for watching SciShow, you can get 20% off!\nAll you have to do is go sign up at Brilliant.org/SciShow. \n[♪ OUTRO]"}

Therefore, even within the unique realms of online social networks, the most fundamental operations of human social networks appear to remain relatively unchanged88, 89. So, it is highly conceivable that the social connections formed in the online world are processed in similar ways to those of the offline world, and thus have much potential to carry over from the Internet to shape “real‐world” sociality, including our social interactions and our perceptions of social hierarchies, in ways that are not restricted to the context of the Internet.","comment":""}

A lot of people think that when you make cars autonomous they'll be able to go faster and that will alleviate congestion. And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy where it's much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a car will be better than that of a bus. Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy and actually traffic will get far worse.\"\n\n[Cited from TED Talk on Youtube, at 11:19](https://youtu.be/zIwLWfaAg-8?t=679)"}

So, the show is about a kid who has this fantasy of being a hero and that opportunity literally lands at his feet. Would the fantasy play out the way it does in movies or comic-book scenes, or would the reality be much different? That was the basic inspiration.","comment":"This is a really good response to a question you will get about GND (or even Pencilmation).

Some states apply the Castle Doctrine if the occupant(s) of the home reasonably believe the intruder intends to commit a lesser felony such as arson or burglary.\nThe occupant(s) of the home must not have provoked or instigated an intrusion; or, provoked/instigated an intruder's threat or use of deadly force.

For example, an organization may have ten people who can perform the role of project manager, although traditionally each project only has one project manager at any one time; and a person who is able to perform the role of project manager may also be able to perform the role of business analyst and tester.\n\nR = Responsible (also recommender)\nThose who do the work to complete the task.[6] There is at least one role with a participation type of responsible, although others can be delegated to assist in the work required (see also RASCI below for separately identifying those who participate in a supporting role).\nA = Accountable (also approver or final approving authority)\nThe one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, the one who ensures the prerequisites of the task are met and who delegates the work to those responsible.[6] In other words, an accountable must sign off (approve) work that responsible provides. There must be only one accountable specified for each task or deliverable.[7]\nC = Consulted (sometimes consultant or counsel)\nThose whose opinions are sought, typically subject-matter experts; and with whom there is two-way communication.[6]\nI = Informed (also informee)\nThose who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable; and with whom there is just one-way communication.[6]\nVery often the role that is accountable for a task or deliverable may also be responsible for completing it (indicated on the matrix by the task or deliverable having a role accountable for it, but no role responsible for its completion, i.e. it is implied). Outside of this exception, it is generally recommended that each role in the project or process for each task receive, at most, just one of the participation types. Where more than one participation type is shown, this generally implies that participation has not yet been fully resolved, which can impede the value of this technique in clarifying the participation of each role on each task.","comment":""}

{"created":1603064285277,"url":"startupoffices.in/what-are-future-trends-in-coworking-space","quote":"We have already seen several large enterprises move into coworking spaces, but there is still a long way to go. According to estimates, coworking or managed offices make up only between 1%-3% of commercial real-estate inventory – but growth is almost doubling every year.\n“The still recovering real estate market, and changing nature of work seems to have created a virtuous circle for coworking – and I think shared workspaces could easily grow to become at least 15%-20% of the total office market in years to come. So, one thing is for sure – the growth will continue. But, it is also true that there are over 300 coworking brands in India – and that might not be the same in the future. I see three major changes happening that will shape the coworking industry,” added Goenka.\n\nOverall predictions say coworking spaces have a bright future in India. By 2025, it is expected that around 42% of the population in India will work in urban centers and hence the demand for office space will increase manifold. With economics playing on the mind of many new businesses, the demand for shared office space will grow tremendously in the next decade. “The model will mature with building owners and operators collaborating together running as a management contract or a revenue share, where the landlord brings in the property and the operator will bring in the expertise to build, market and operate the flexible office space,” concluded Mathur.","comment":""}

Central planning was too cumbersome, too slow to respond to the body’s emergencies.

Movement, even in A.I., was not just a lower, practical function that could be grafted, at a later stage, onto abstract reason. The line between action and thought was more blurry than it seemed.

Other disruptive technologies such as the Blockchain also have an enormous potential to be integrated into the co-living sector through multiple angles, such as through rental payments, insurance provisions, medical assistance and group voting techniques. According to a sharing platform called the Coliving Club, blockchain technology also has the potential to disrupt the real estate sector, ultimately facilitating the development of shared living spaces:\n\n“Some of the issues in buying and selling real estate are bureaucracy, lack of transparency, fraud, and mistakes in public records. Using blockchain technology can speed up transactions by reducing the need for paper-based record keeping. It can also help with tracking, verifying ownership, ensuring accuracy of documents, and transferring property deeds”.\n\nFor example, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) blockchain platforms such as Ubitquity help increase transparency in real estate deals by inputting property information and record documents directly onto the blockchain with secure recording and tracking methods. At the moment the use of these decentralized platforms is ripe with potential, and these technologies can catalyze the co-living movement into a leader of real estate, tech and social entrepreneurship sectors.\n\nThe co-living sector can be grateful for these technological innovations; in a way, technology has facilitated the emergence of the sector by creating a need for physical interaction and connection and at the same time the potential for integrating IOT and decentralized technologies into co-living spaces and management is strong. PUREHOUSE LAB is working to connect thought leaders in these different sectors to one another in order to develop these technologies for the co-living sector, and we are aiming to facilitate the creation of disruptive platforms for governance, finance, management and communication for shared living spaces.","comment":""}

Promoting empathy and positivity is key.

Friston’s version of free energy—prediction error—could sound at first as if it were all about cognition, just as Freud’s version could sound at first as if it were all about sex, but at root they were both about survival. Minimizing prediction error, in other words, was much bigger than it sounded. When the brain strove to minimize prediction error, it was not just trying to reduce its uncertainty about what was going on in the world; it was struggling to resolve the contradictions between fantasy and reality—ideally by making reality more like fantasy. The brain had to do two things in order to survive: it had to impel its body to get what it needed, and it had to form an understanding of the world that was realistic enough to guide it in doing so. Free energy was the force that drove both.","comment":""}

The risk of gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicity is much lower with topical NSAIDs as compared with its oral formulation due to the reduced systemic absorption (5- to 17-fold lower for topical diclofenac compared with oral) [32,33]. The tolerability profile is also better with topical NSAIDs, with mild skin rashes being the most commonly reported side effect. The drugs studied with the most frequency were diclofenac gel or solution and ketoprofen, applied over the affected knee two to four times daily, for the duration necessary to control symptoms. We most commonly use diclofenac gel, but the choice of topical agent may vary according to local availability and cost.","comment":""}

{"created":1605538805050,"url":"imrg.org/switzerland-marketing","quote":"Home\r\n ›  Marketing in Switzerland\r\nMarketing and branding\r\nDeveloping a market presence in any international market is a challenge, particularly where brand awareness is low, and the retail offer isn’t that different form local providers. Where a merchant is selling an own-brand product, creating a place in the market can be a little easier than for those brands selling a more widely available product.\r\n\r\nHowever, digital marketing enables merchants to reach new markets without having a local presence. Digital advertising expenditure totalled over $ 1.17 bn in 2016. According to Media Focus, 42% of advertising expenditure in Switzerland is still going to print media, with only 11% going to digital channels.\r\n\r\nA review of data from Google’s Consumer Barometer shows that the research process that customers use to inform their buying decisions follows the same patterns as in other western economies.\r\nHow did people use the internet to help make their purchase decisions?\r\n\r\nFigure 12: The role of the internet in consumers buying decisions. Source: Google Consumer Barometer 2017.\r\n\r\nDiscovery, prices, and peer reviews are key areas that many retailers will already understand. Swiss shoppers are no different. What is different in Switzerland is the use of non-digital media channels and the role they play in driving online traffic.\r\n\r\nOnline retail in Switzerland employs a wide range of media components in order to promote sales and brands. TV advertising still plays a major part in the marketing mix, with an average share of spend around 23%. Interestingly, food retailing is the biggest user of TV advertising.\r\nCategory share of advertising channel budgets\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Category share of advertising channel budgets. Source: VSV ASVAD / GfK 2016\r\n\r\nIn common with other markets, display has an important but limited share of the overall mix. Home electronics makes the most use with the category spending just over 8% of the total category advertising media budget. This category also makes use of print media, although the biggest category in this medium is Health, which allocates 38% of its budget to print advertising.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that direct mail still has a prominent role, being the biggest promotion channel in the clothing/sport category. In fact, it enjoys the biggest share of spend of any other communications channel, with 42% of the total spend being allocated.\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Media expenditure share for online retail. Source: VSV ASVAD / GfK March 2017.\r\n\r\nGfK data published in March 2017 highlighted the changing trends in budget allocation by media channel. What might be surprising to international merchants is the growth in non-digital channels such as TV, out-of-home and radio. A large fall in display advertising might not be a surprise as business move to performance-based marketing techniques. Direct mail, however, still represents the largest share of media spend, at CHF 124 m. The three-year trend though is a downwards adjustment. Google’s Consumer Barometer reports that 10% of online purchase are informed by direct mail activity.\r\n\r\nIt isn’t clear from these figures though if there is a reassignment of budgets to other channels, as overall spend is down marginally. Search marketing saw a modest fall in 2016 — certainly not something experienced in other advanced digital markets.\r\n\r\nTo provide some context, GfK looked at three big online retailers to understand their investment strategies in the various media channels. Amazon primarily focuses on search, spending over CHF 3,000. Ricardo.ch reduced spend on search by 74% in 2016 but increased print by 16%; now spending more on this media channel than on digital advertising. Siroop used considerable budgets across multiple channels, perhaps in response to a strengthening Amazon offer in to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nFigure 15: Marketing budget investment in media channels for thee multi-category online retailers. Source: GfK March 2017.\r\n\r\nTypically, this budget is spent on performance based activity so would see a direct correlation with gaining importance as a mechanism for increasing relevancy and cost effectiveness of advertising, programmatic trading — where algorithms running on service provider’s servers allocate advertising placement in real-time — is accounting for a bigger proportion of digital budget. There is an increasing focus on tying other marketing channels together with online activity. For example, there has been an increase in TV advertising by online retailers to drive traffic via apps and mobile enabled websites. This is driven by the increasing ‘second screening’ behaviour. Swiss researchers have also noted that, rather than switching channels during commercial breaks, viewers are going online via a mobile device until the program resumes.\r\n\r\nMobile marketing costs are actually a little more expensive than in other markets. For example, Mindshare quoted in a 2013 report that a Cost Per Thousand (CPM) price range of CHF15 to CHF50 isn’t uncommon.\r\n\r\nFigure 16: Typical mobile marketing engagement costs. Source: Mindshare, 2013\r\n\r\nAccording to IAB Switzerland, local digital industries are focusing on a small number of key developments in 2018. Primarily, these are the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (Swiss comparable legislation currently being drawn up); Artificial Intelligence, Programmatic advertising and machine learning.","comment":""}

One has to realise that the concept of temperature {\\displaystyle T} cannot be attributed to an arbitrarily microscopic particle since this does not radiate thermally like a macroscopic or ``black body´´. However, one can attribute a nonzero entropy {\\displaystyle S} to an object with as few as two states like a ``bit´´ (and nothing else). The entropies of the two cases are called thermal entropy and von Neumann entropy respectively.[15] They are also distinguished by the terms coarse grained and fine grained respectively.

Here are some ways in which smart technology is reshaping how hoteliers operate.\n\nSelf check-in\n\nToday, the guest does not want to wait at the reception desk, and they are expecting everything digital in your hotel. However, self-check-in service by a mobile app is the best solution for customers as well as hotel management staff.\n\nAlso, with this, the guests can easily find out whether their room is ready, can make requests for amenities and many more.\n\nMobile room keys\n\nA smartphone app that provides guest room access, eliminates the problem of attendees losing their key card or the environmental impact of countless plastic cards. This could help your corporate social responsibility image. It’s a win-win!\n\n3) Reserved Parking\n\nSmart sensors and hotel apps will allow guests to not only reserve parking spots ahead of their visits, but to also have their spot assigned at their arrival. This will give your guests an effortless experience from the minute they pull up.\n\n4) Online Reputation Management\n\nA hotel’s online ratings can not only help predict future bookings, but they offer owners valuable insight into how well a property delivered on guest expectations. Therefore, operators will continue to invest in platforms such as STAAH’s review minder, that help them monitor online reviews, manage their online reputation and use that feedback to improve both their operational and guest experience standards.\n\n5) Room service\n\nHotels will be able to push menu notifications to guests’ smartphones when they are in their rooms using smart occupancy sensors. They can also schedule texts tailored to fit their preferred ordering times, including personalised menu suggestions based on previous orders.","comment":""}

The most important quality is determination. There’s got to be at least one founder who's super determined. I've seen so many smart and talented people fail because they couldn't stick with it when things got tough. Startups are really hard and take a really long time. There has to be at least one founder who's just a tower of strength.\n\nPart of being determined is being able to withstand rejection. People will think your idea is lame, customers won't be interested, investors will say no, reporters won't care. And they might not be polite about it either. But you can't let rejection discourage you. This is really hard for a lot of people.\n\nThe second thing you need in the founding team is domain expertise. At least one of the founders should be an expert in what you're working on. Which means if you're starting a software startup, at least one of the founders should be a programmer. You can get away with hiring programmers, but you're more likely to succeed if the founders themselves at least know how to program, even if they're not great at it.\n\nI'm not saying that you can't be successful if you aren't a programmer. But if I had to suggest the best way to spend a year preparing to be a founder, it would be to learn the basics of coding. I've seen so many women who had great ideas for startups but couldn't implement them, and had to either outsource their initial version to a development shop, or worse, recruit a cofounder they didn't know just because that person could program. Time after time I've seen these companies blow up, when if the founder had only known enough programming to make a prototype, they probably would have gone on to succeed.\n\nThe third quality you need in the founders is the ability, or at least willingness, to sell. Someone has to be the face of the company—to sell the product to customers, and sell the company itself to investors, the press, and potential hires. At least one of you is going to have to sell. ","comment":""}

Having a private outdoor space to relax or workout is a luxury many live without in London.\n\nEvents – Although we no longer have events in person, Gravity is still working hard to offer a variety of virtual activities, from Coffee break catch-ups, Quiz nights to virtual HIIT’s, Yoga, games and much more. All our members are encouraged to not only participate but also create their own events – never a boring moment at Gravity!\n\nFlexibility – In the uncertainty of what lies ahead, many people may not be comfortable signing long leases. We offer flexible contracts so members can have peace of mind and know they are free to leave with just 1-month notice.\n\nAll-inclusive – With a million thoughts and worries to deal with, our members can relax knowing that their monthly fee covers it all. We take the stress, so you don’t have to!\n\nPartnerships – From the beginning, we always wanted to create partnerships with companies that shared our ethos.

A perfectionist, Mr. Evans also tended to be unduly harsh on himself and agonized over every setback and perceived misstep, his partner, Mr. Lutz, said.\n\n“Beneath all of his calm, the charming exterior, was someone who struggled with self doubt,” Mr. Lutz said. “I was always just seeing the tip of the iceberg, and I knew that.”\n\nIn fall 2019, Mr. Evans’s mental state took a turn for the worse as he juggled state officials’ last-minute requests, like the addition of a 12-foot-tall clock that hangs from the atrium, and heightened pressure to complete the whole project no later than Dec. 31, 2020.","comment":""}

They’re animating the show in Toon Boom Harmony. We have about 45 people in our Netflix Animation team in L.A., and the Mercury Filmworks side has about 110 members at a time. Each episode takes approximately a year and a half from writing start to finish. One of the great things about having 10 episodes to work on is that you can focus on making each episode unique and special, and you’re not churning out volume, which is an opportunity I’ve never had before.","comment":"This is super important info. But I'm confused... so it's taken 2 years since the Netflix partnership happened fr the show to be released, and it takes 1.5 years (!!!) to make each episode start to finish, and yet I'm guessing the entire season 1 will be released at once in February of March 2021?? Assuming he wrote the episodes really quickly, I still don't see how this adds up...Can you explain it to me?"}

More recent studies have shown that illusions of self‐knowledge similarly persist when using smartphones to retrieve online information58.

Besides self-check-in/out, robots with standardized disinfection methods can deliver goods to guest rooms, such as room service, newspaper, parcels as well as other guest amenities requested from guest orders via the application.\n\nBecause implementing similar procedures may require major capital investment, hotels can also minimize cross-infection through ‘low-tech’ measures. Such actions would include equipping employees with hand sanitizers, minimizing cash payments and setting up occupancy quotas per floor to ensure the distance between two occupied rooms. Signs and reminders about maintaining social distancing and personal hygiene can be both helpful and reassuring. Ultimately, the most pragmatic way is to use existing resources at a minimized cost to reformat the service procedure and reduce the points of contacts in the process.","comment":""}

This unique event has forced us to reflect on our habits in a globalised world. Health and safety measures will go under the microscope like never before as we reconsider what traveling safely really looks like. While hygiene and health have always been important aspects of hospitality and catering, they could now be the decisive reason for winning – and losing – customers.\n\nTherefore, we can expect new technologies facilitating health and safety to be created and applied. Self-sanitising door handles and facial recognition that aids contactless check-ins could become a ‘must have’ in the near future.\n\nIndeed, while some tools were previously dismissed as fun gadgets, they may become indispensable for business continuity. For instance, we found in the above-mentioned study that virtual reality is already very popular among travellers. In the present context, the use of virtual reality could increase, especially with the aim of helping potential hotel guests in the booking phase by offering them a virtual tour of the location and verifying that social distancing rules can be applied. Similarly, robots and smart assistants could be used to handle customer requests, therefore limiting contamination risks.","comment":""}

Clark started musing about the ways in which even adult thought was often scaffolded by things outside the head. There were many kinds of thinking that weren’t possible without a pen and paper, or the digital equivalent—complex mathematical calculations, for instance. Writing prose was usually a matter of looping back and forth between screen or paper and mind: writing something down, reading it over, thinking again, writing again. The process of drawing a picture was similar. The more he thought about these examples, the more it seemed to him that to call such external devices “scaffolding” was to underestimate their importance. They were, in fact, integral components of certain kinds of thought. And so, if thinking extended outside the brain, then the mind did, too.","comment":""}

One argument often heard against vi is that it has modes: sometimes, typing an 'x' inserts the letter 'x' into the text, and other times, it acts as a command (erasing a character, as it happens). While vi's successor, vim, does a much better job of showing in which mode you are, Jef's point is that the mode indicator is not at the user's locus of attention: that is the insert point in the text, while the mode indicator (at least when using the terminal version) is at the bottom of the screen. If you are distracted for a few seconds and then go back to your editing, you may not notice the mode indicator in the corner of your peripheral vision, and you will start typing assuming the wrong mode. Sure enough, that has happened to me many times. (Emacs has modes too though! For example, I often find myself inexplicably in a modal dialog, or accidentally typing into a \"dired\" window.)\n\n","comment":"If [[mode]]s don't have a clear indicator of which mode you are in, they can lead to you trying to do things you can't and ending up [[frustrated]]"}

Even if you’re city-based, there are plenty of ideas you can incorporate to help you offer your guests an escape from their pandemic life.\nAffordability and accessibility – Local sights and tourist destinations are not only more affordable for cash-strapped travelers, but are more accessible under restrictive travel laws and the risk of lockdowns – it’s easy and safe to get in the car and explore your local countryside for a weekend, while international or regional travel is seen as far more high-risk and challenging","comment":""}

Whilst it would be hard to deny that systems exist in society, Luhmann’s particular method argues for systems as the way in which social complexity is reduced. In the same manner that a conversation revolves around a topic, social systems are only concerned with their particular interest which allows them to ignore anything that is not pertinent. The pitfalls of trying to tie social functioning down to a prevailing ideology then are avoided at the cost of decoupling the individual from society and placing them within its environment.\n\n","comment":""}

Connectionists took a different tack, by attempting to simulate the way that millions of neurons, each of which was very simple and responded only to its immediate neighbors, combined in the brain to produce complex cognition. Instead of programming an artificial neural network with symbolic knowledge, a language that was complete from the get-go, the idea was to see if artificial networks could learn, a little at a time, building on very simple beginnings. And, indeed, the new neural networks appeared to be much more flexible and robust than the symbolic systems had been—they could survive damage and noise.","comment":""}

[Merriwether] took this idea and made it into a writing exercise. We would all write 10 nouns on small pieces of paper and put them in a hat.

The burden of proof of fact is much less challenging than that of justifying a homicide in self-defense. With justifiable homicide in self-defense, one generally must objectively prove to a trier of fact, against all reasonable doubt, the intent in the intruder's mind to commit violence or a felony. It would be a misconception of law to infer that because a state has a justifiable homicide in self-defense provision pertaining to one's domicile, it has a castle doctrine protecting the estate and exonerating any duty whatsoever to retreat therefrom. The doctrine can be misused as a pretext for extrajudicial punishment in private spaces. The use of this legal principle in the United States has been controversial in relation to a number of cases in which it has been invoked, including the deaths of Japanese exchange student Yoshihiro Hattori and Scottish businessman Andrew de Vries.","comment":""}

As proof, $2.1 billion has been spent globally on blockchain solutions in 2018, and accelerating. This is a clear indicator that this emerging technology is here to stay and bring increased opportunities with it.\r\n\r\n“Blockchain is a decentralised database, with inherent governance that, in the main, allows one to scale trust.” - Joerg Esser (former director Thomas Cook)\r\n\r\nThink of the blockchain as a ‘new internet for the travel industry’. Where we once thought the internet would be a fad, we all now are incredibly reliant on it for every aspect of our lives.\r\n\r\nBlockchain might well be a revolutionary technology that could shape the future of travel - especially payment settlement and fraud prevention. Blockchain technology is, in its simplest form, a way to move information from one point to another in a highly secure manner. When used with the cryptocurrency bitcoin, it essentially cuts out financial middlemen. Blockchain permanently records transactions in an open, encrypted ledger that provides direct payment to sellers.\r\n\r\nThe goals of blockchain technology in the hospitality/hotel industry is eliminating third-party costs, and encouraging direct provider to consumer interaction.\r\n\r\nDon’t expect online travel agencies to necessairly rush into any decentralizing technology such as Blockchain. The reality is the online travel agencies sit at the top of the 50-year-old distribution-food chain.\r\n\r\nIt has the potential to vastly reduce the market share of OTAs and intermediaries. Under blockchain, OTAs will continue doing business but in a fairer playing field. However, they might start to face greater competition, as anyone can source rooms from blockchain. This will release the OTA’s stronghold on having exclusive inventory which can deter them from charging exorbitant commissions. On the other hand, metasearch engines like TripAdvisor and Trivago, might have a tough time dealing with the blockchain platform. These search engines capitalise on the flaws in the distribution system to generate their revenues. The flaws might be minimised with the wider presence of blockchain.","comment":""}

Five minutes later, everyone took a final true-or-false test about what they had originally seen.\n\nIn this final test, the volunteers were worse at accurately recalling details that were changed in the audio recap, but only if they had previously answered questions that made them recall the video.

But this view of memory is quite wrong. Memories are not filed away in the brain like so many video cassettes, to be slotted in and played when it's time to recall the past. Sci-fi and fantasy fictions might try to persuade us otherwise, but memories are not discrete entities that can be taken out of one person's head, Dumbledore-style, and distilled for someone else's viewing. They are mental reconstructions, nifty multimedia collages of how things were, that are shaped by how things are now. Autobiographical memories are stitched together as and when they are needed from information stored in many different neural systems. That makes them curiously susceptible to distortion, and often not nearly as reliable as we would like.","comment":""}

Still, there are a few essential factors to consider:\n\nDoes the body have authority to consider systemic change, or only to review a specific incident? Back-end review is important in all areas of government, but real change requires evaluation of systemic policies and practices. Incident review occurs at the back end, while systemic change comes at the front. Learn more.\n\n\nDoes the body have authority to mandate change, or only to recommend it? Of the front-end bodies we identified, all but 6 have advisory authority only. Binding authority is a way to increase the likelihood of systemic change taking place. To be clear, the power to recommend change can be substantial as well, but in that case the advisory body must depend on other factors, such as open access to information and sufficient resources. Learn more.\n\n\nDoes the body have the budget and resources to make a difference? Even a body with tremendous power on paper will ultimately have limited impact unless it has adequate resources to conduct investigations, learn from community members, and research policy changes. In our review we found that the inspectors general, by virtue of being a separate city agency, generally were given substantial funding. Among the remaining front-end bodies, however, only 6 had considerable funding and staffing (e.g., administrative assistants, investigators, and community liaisons) to carry out their work. Learn more.\n\n\nDoes the body have access to the information it needs to carry out its work? Systemic change cannot occur without understanding the issues at hand. To be effective, a public body must be able to identify trends in policies and practices that persistently lead to negative outcomes, as well as patterns in officer misconduct. In order to carry out this analysis, the body requires access to internal police documents such as general orders and misconduct complaints. Learn more.\n\n\nDoes the body communicate regularly with community members, especially to get their feedback on issues that concern them? Oversight bodies should represent the interests of community members, but as commissioners and inspectors general are not elected to these positions, it is critical that they form connections with the general public. This includes hosting public meetings and conducting outreach activities to keep the public informed and solicit feedback. Oversight bodies should also regularly release public reports (including any applicable raw data) to promote their own transparency and accountability. Learn more.","comment":""}

sorry.\"\nWith so many varieties\nin our skin tones,\nhair colors,\nand features,\nthe human race\nis a marvel of evolution.\nBut what if we all decided\nto preserve our family traits?\nWhat if everyone started\ninbreeding tomorrow?\ninbreeding might be a topic\nreserved for today's daytime talk shows,\nit was once a common practice\namong royalty.\nIn 1661,\nPrince Charles II of Spain\nwas born to parents\nwho were uncle and niece.\nUnable to speak\nuntil he was four\nor walk until he was eight,\nhe was the product of centuries\nof inbreeding.\nGenetically speaking,\nhis family history made Charles II\nmore inbred\nthan a child born\nto a brother and sister.\nSo, if we all started inbreeding,\nFirst, let's clear up any confusion.\nInbreeding is when two close relatives\nhave a child together.\nInbreeding is how early humans survived\nwhen there were not many people\non the planet.\nBut 75,000 years ago,\nhumanity almost faced a similar fate.\nThe Toba volcano erupted in Indonesia\n75,000 years ago,\nexploding with the force of\nThe debris and clouds\nblacked out the sky\nfor almost six years,\nplunging Earth into an ice age.\nIt nearly wiped humanity\noff the face of the Earth.\nAccording to geneticist Dr. Barry Starr,\nthere were no more than\n1,000 breeding pairs\nof humans left.\nAnd with so few people,\nhumans were forced to repopulate with,\nwell, whoever was left alive.\nAnd often, that meant your own family.\nSo to an extent,\nwe're all a little inbred.\nBut that 0.1% difference\nin our DNA is hugely important.\nAnd if we were to decide\nto keep our family traits\nin only our families,\nwe might do some severe damage\nto our genomes.\nLet's take a closer look.\nSee, we all have\n23 pairs of organized DNA,\ncalled chromosomes,\nin each cell's nucleus.\nAnd every pair of chromosomes\nhas a copy of each parent's genes.\nSome animals are inbred\nfor their desirable traits.\nInbreeding may have given your dog\nits loveable, floppy ears.\nBut in humans,\nthe results may not be so cute\nor desirable.\nIf you breed with someone\nwho has the same faulty genes\nthat you have,\nit could produce a child\nwho inherits a lot\nof medical problems.\nIn fact,\nfirst cousins have an 8% chance\nof having a child\nwith a problem after birth.\nYour kids might develop cystic fibrosis,\na blood disease,\nor even heart problems.\nBut the real damage\nwould come generations later.\nBy then,\nwith less diversity in your gene pool,\nit might be harder for your body\nto survive changes\nin the environment.\nResearchers at the\nEindhoven University of Technology\nfound that inbreeding\nmay have caused the Neanderthals\nto go extinct.\nSimulations show that\nthis early version of humans\nlived in small groups.\nTheir bad genes\ncaused their birth rates to decrease,\nuntil eventually,\nthey died out.\nAnd if our descendants\ncan't adapt easily,\ntheir babies could die more often\nthan ours do.\nSo, if you want to decrease\nthe chance of that happening,\nyou'll need to breed further down\nyour family tree.\nInterestingly,\na study of Icelandic couples found that\nthose who married a third cousin\nproduced more children\nthan previously unrelated couples.\nLet's make it clear.\nInbreeding itself\ndoesn't create bad genes.\nBut if you and your partner\nhave the same bad gene,\nit's more likely that you'll pass\nit on to your child.\nBut if both parents\ndo not have\nthe same genetic mutation,\ntheir chance of giving birth\nto a healthy baby\nis the same\nas a non-related couple's.\nIf we all start inbreeding,\nand parents become more aware\nof the risks to their children,\nit might lead to increased monitoring\nof the womb.\nAnd parents might choose\nwho their children mate with,\nbased on the genetic traits\nof their family members.\nGenerations of children\ncould have their love lives mapped out\nbefore they're even born.\nSince you'd all be marrying\nwithin your family,\nyou would have a greater need\nfor genetic counselors.\nAnd for medical professionals\nto deal with the genetic diseases\nbeing passed to the children.\nIf you become\nmuch more aware of the problems\nyou might give to your offspring,\nwould you take better care of yourself?\nNone of us can avoid\na genetic problem\nwe're born with.\nAnd we don't control\nwho our parents are.\nBut you might choose\nto control how much\nalcohol you drink,\nor eat better food,\nor even pop a vitamin\nnow and then.\nWhile some people might think that\nthey could be preserving a culture\nor certain traits through inbreeding,\nit might have the opposite effect.\nAnd, like what happened\nto the Neanderthals,\nif there's not enough cultural diversity,\nsome genetic traits would just die out.\nIf something causes our population\nto drastically decrease,\nwe might have to think twice\nabout inbreeding.\nLike, what if there were only\n1,000 people left on Earth?\nWell, that's a story for another WHAT IF.","comment":""}

To find their way home, the two must travel across the seemingly supernatural forest with the occasional help of the wandering, mysterious and elderly Woodsman (Christopher Lloyd) and Beatrice (Melanie Lynskey), an irritable bluebird who travels with the boys to find a woman called Adelaide, who can supposedly undo the curse on Beatrice and her family and show the half-brothers the way home.[5]\n\nWirt, the older brother, is a worry-prone teenager who would rather keep to himself than have to make a decision. His passions including playing the clarinet and writing poetry,[6] but he usually keeps these private out of fear of being mocked. On the other hand, Greg, the younger brother, is more naïve and carefree, much to Wirt's chagrin. Greg carries a frog (Jack Jones) that he found; Greg's attempts to give the frog a name are a running gag. Stalking the main cast is the Beast (Samuel Ramey), an ancient creature who leads lost souls astray until they lose their hope and willpower and turn into \"Edelwood trees\".[7] Once they find Adelaide, Wirt discovers that she intends only to enslave the boys; outraged that Beatrice misled them, Wirt takes Greg and abandons her.","comment":"There's even a pet frog!\nStrange plot.."}

It is identified as a critical business risk by many studies and research. It is also very frequently discussed in the circles.\r\n\r\nWhen talking about why employers go for the gig economy, most leaders and managers stated that one of the main reasons was the flexibility that this type of employment provides. The next drivers were access to expertise, efficiency, and cost. There are currently approximately 170 gig economy companies in the United States that only hire remote workers. This validates the fact that there is a high level of executive confidence in the durability of the gig economy.","comment":"the company trusts the process"}

Provide food delivery service from hotels\nThe key motivation behind this action is cost-saving, as well as being a way to recover revenue. Since the raw material cost represents 45%-50% of five-star properties’ daily food sales on normal days, food delivery would at least cover the cost of the existing inventory which would otherwise perish for nothing. \n\nFor implementing this measure, we have the following advice:\n\nAs you are going to compete with other restaurants which usually have significantly lower per-cover cost, it is necessary to adapt the menu accordingly.\nIt is crucial to find suitable partners for ensuring appropriate pick-up procedures and seamless online delivery service so high-quality food is delivered to customers. The choice of partner will also impact the per-cover margin, as the food delivery hoteliers in China reported that the average commission fee could be up to 20%.\nIf your hotel has unique selling proposition food items with relatively low material cost and these food items are suitable for packaging and delivery, this can be an opportunity for strengthening your relationship with the local community. For example, some five-star properties in Shanghai and Nanjing have reported success stories of enjoying high demand with their dim-sum products when their restaurants were closed.","comment":""}

Единственное - специализация косметолог-эстетист не мифична и не придумана в нехороших салонах) Если правильнее - косметик-эстетист (согласно российскому законодательству) - это специалист по предоставлению бытовых услуг (что особенно важно - не медицинских). Важно знать, что косметик-эстетист - это человек, который не может осуществлять медицинские вмешательства, а ограничивается таким перечнем услуг как депиляция, пилинг, массаж и т.д. Так, в косметологии различают несколько специальностей: врач дерматолог или дерматовенеролог, медицинская сестра в косметологии и косметик-эстетист. Каждый из них имеет свой ограниченный спектр возможностей и оказываемых услуг.\nВ видео Вы абсолютно верно делаете акцент на том, что медицинские услуги в центрах и салонах может осуществлять только специалист с квалификацией врача (или же медицинская сестра в косметологии, но только при назначении врача дерматовенеролога). Но не стоит утверждать, что кроме врачей дерматовенерологов в салонах никто не имеет права работать) \nСпасибо.","comment":"[LinkText](url)"}

For example, scale and available space especially in communal areas, gyms, shared kitchens, etc. will be a premium because people can spread out while still being in visual proximity. At TSH, we have large communal spaces so we can maintain that community vibe even from a distance. Our motto for the design team these days is “making safe still fun”.

Perception did not, then, simply work from the bottom up; it worked first from the top down. What you saw was not just a signal from the eye, say, but a combination of that signal and the brain’s own ideas about what it expected to see, and sometimes the brain’s expectations took over altogether. How could it be that some people saw a dress as white and gold while others saw the same dress as blue and black? Brains did not perceive color straightforwardly: an experienced brain knew that an object would look darker and less vivid in shade than in the sun, and so adjusted its perception of the “true” color based on what it judged to be the object’s situation. (Psychologists speculate that a brain’s assumptions about color may be set by whether a person spends more time in daylight or artificial light.)","comment":""}

I love narrative. It’s the only thing I read, and it’s fantastically seductive. When I say “narrative,” I don’t mean a chronology of events; I mean stories with plots, connected by motivations, by people’s beliefs and desires, their plans, intentions, values. There’s a story.\n\nThe problem is, these historical narratives seduce you into thinking you really understand what’s going on and why things happened, but most of it is guessing people’s motives and their inner thoughts. It allays your curiosity, and you’re satisfied psychologically by the narrative, and it connects the dots so you feel you’re in the shoes of the person whose narrative is being recorded. It has seduced you into a false account, and now you think you understand.\n\nThe second part is that it effectively prevents you from going on to try to find the right theory and correct account of events. And the third problem, which is the gravest, is that people use narratives because of their tremendous emotional impact to drive human actions, movements, political parties, religions, ideologies. And many movements, like nationalism and intolerant religions, are driven by narrative and are harmful and dangerous for humanity.","comment":"This is the crux."}

While the documentation of such 'community spread' cases have yet to be fully synthesized, one inference already clear is that gig economy jobs naturally compel those who are sick to keep working due to a firm lack of support for time off.\nWhile monitoring Uber drivers is beyond your control, the first step is to set strict guidelines for your servers, housekeepers and other associates. All senior team members should meet with their colleagues, insisting that everyone to stay home if they are not well and to err on the side of caution.\n\nTo successfully accomplish this, hourly employees need to be reassured that they will not lose their pay. This may require a change in policies regarding pay-for-work that should be discussed with HR and Finance. Consider having every worker sign a code of conduct that reflects this mindset.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\nHotel Cleanliness is Now a Theatrical Production\nHousekeeping to Take Centerstage in the New Normal\nGetting Back On The Road: 9 Things To Plan For As Travel Resumes\nview all\nOffsite Work Policies\n\nInvestigate jobs that can be completed from home or a remote location. Sales leaders should work from home where possible and limit their availability on property to 'as needed'. You should look into remote reservations services. With training, it is possible for them to answer all of your telephone reservations. Moreover, with fewer guests to manage, now is the ideal time to thoroughly investigate technology solutions that enable offsite productivity.\nGreeting Guests\n\nYour approach to greeting guests, fellow employees, suppliers and all others should minimize direct contact. While it is hard to break the habit, handshaking should be temporarily eliminated. Think elbow bump! While normal guest service calls for coming out from behind the front desk to greet customers, we should now keep our distance and explicitly explain the rationale for this. Your visitors will appreciate it.\nCleanliness Theatre\n\nDo you remember after 9/11 when they had a row of soldiers standing outside the airports with M16s at the ready? This is a classic example of 'security theatre' whereby this tactic was essentially ineffective at stopping terrorist attacks save for reassuring passengers. The same is now true with 'cleanliness theatre' where it's equally as important to restore guest confidence by fully showing the new measures you are taking as the measures themselves.\nThis starts in the public spaces. Set reinforced guidelines for staff handwashing practices and additional room cleaning SOPs. Install extra hand sanitizer stations in the front lobby, restaurant, spa and fitness center. Review procedures for all cleaning with priority given to handrails, public washrooms and the front desk area. While hoteliers typically shun visible cleaning crews operating while guests present, in today's panic the opposite is true. And as the final major component of this cleanliness theatre, broadcast your new measures through the website, newsletter and social media so everyone knows you are staying vigilant.\n\nCancellations\n\nBe flexible in understanding guests' hysteria regarding the virus. Staff training in restaurants should include empathy for guests who might not want to sit close to others and being prepared to anticipate requests to be well-spaced in the dining room. Show added flexibility in terms of cancellations, even for OTA bookings. As a matter of policy, you should discuss full refunds versus credits for future use with individuals and groups.\nStaffing Levels\n\nThe number of onsite employees must be managed according to occupancy levels and monitored on a daily basis. Although many properties are currently in the slow season, the jury is still out as to how long the threat of this virus will impact business. At this juncture, improvements may not be anticipated until the summer months.\nAnother scenario to consider is temporarily closing your property altogether with plans to reopen in summer. While this extreme should be handled on a case-by-case basis, you must nevertheless prepare for the worst and be pleasantly surprised if events turn out otherwise.\n\nPersonally, I am anticipating that once some form of 'all clear' is given, there will be a surge in travel bookings as leisure guests will yearn for a last-minute summer vacations and group operators look to get back on pace. In the meantime, stay safe and best of luck!","comment":""}

What was clear was that 50% of all the viewership was music-related. But maybe, 25% was kids’ related. I found that very fascinating, especially when I dived further into the data. I discovered that what our kids are watching and spending two-and-a-half hours of their screen time a day watching, is what I call mom-and-pop shops. There are no brands that we’re aware of. There are many reasons for that, but that’s where our kids are spending two-thirds of their time. I started going further and further into that and said there’s a huge opportunity here to buy these great content-creators who are creating great IP for the new generation that our kids have complete affection to and are engaging with every single day, and make it better, create more, stronger narrative, better animation, etc. Then distribute it all over the world, and create new digital franchises. I pitched that internally at Disney. My two bosses, at that time, were Andy Bird, international president of the Walt Disney Corporation, and Kevin Mayer. They really liked it, but we needed to find a home. Finding a home for a new business, incubated inside this institution is very difficult, especially if it’s not creating billions of dollars in EBITDA overnight. It was a strong business plan that every private equity, every investor will jump on, but it was difficult. It was difficult in the business that was getting disrupted by streaming and to focus on it, which understandable. I said, “This is too good to be true.” There’s a huge market opportunity. There’s a market fit, obviously, and nobody’s doing it. I went around to a few investors, and all of them, I knew very well from the last many years. One of them was Reign, who specialized in the entertainment industry, broadly speaking. For them, it was a no-brainer. They’d been looking at the kids’ space for a very long time but were waiting for the right business model and the right team. For me, knowing them very well, and I needed a big check to go and consolidate and invest in the business, we just did it right away. Again, back to your previous question, what makes you realize that they’re the right partner? It was clear — Fred Davis, Joe Rabbids, Jason, and all the rest that I knew. I just put chemistry. They are great guys. They have phenomenal knowledge of the industry. But they’re also very nice and good guys. I thought I could definitely go and create a partnership with them and create something big. That’s how Moonbug Entertainment started.","comment":""}

As right prefrontal regions are typically activated in response to distractor stimuli, the observed increases in recruitment of these regions alongside poorer performance suggests that heavy media multi‐taskers require greater cognitive effort to maintain concentration when faced with distractor stimuli29. Structurally, high levels of Internet usage30 and heavy media multi‐tasking31 are associated with decreased grey matter in prefrontal regions associated with maintaining goals in face of distraction (such as the right frontal pole and anterior cingulate cortex). However, the findings to date must be interpreted with caution, as various confounding factors may be affecting the results of these cross‐sectional imaging studies. Although the differences persist when controlling for general digital media use and other simple confounders (age, gender, etc.), further research is required to examine if the observed neural differences are specifically attributable to heavy vs. light media multi‐tasking, or in fact driven by broader differences in lifestyle between the two groups.","comment":""}
