# memex-data-dump

This is a massive WIP hack for reverse engineering an API from memex so that:

1. we can develop and showcase tools that are interopable with memex before it has an API formalised
2. we can spec out the API we want so that memex can implement it

Please do not share, or look at the data files directly (GDPR).
